# Subject

```
This project is about creating a dating website. 
You will need to create an app allowing two potential lovers to meet, 
from the registration to the final encounter.

A user will then be able to register, connect, fill his/her profile, 
search and look into the profile of other users, like them, 
chat with those that “liked” back.
